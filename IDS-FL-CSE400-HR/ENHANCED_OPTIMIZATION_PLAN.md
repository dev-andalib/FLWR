# ENHANCED FEDERATED LEARNING CONFIGURATION

## 🎯 **OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY FOR MULTICLASS IMPROVEMENT**

### **CURRENT PERFORMANCE BASELINE:**
- **Multiclass Accuracy**: 17.4% → 32.8% (88% improvement in 2 rounds)
- **Binary Accuracy**: 88-89% (excellent for intrusion detection)
- **Trend**: Positive improvement trajectory

### **🚀 ENHANCED CONFIGURATION APPLIED:**

#### **1. FEDERATED LEARNING SCALING:**
```toml
num-server-rounds = 5          # 2→5 (150% increase)
local-epochs = 8               # 3→8 (167% increase)  
num-supernodes = 3             # 2→3 (50% increase)
```

#### **2. TRAINING PHASE OPTIMIZATION:**
```python
Binary Phase: 5→8 epochs       # Stronger foundation
Multiclass Phase: 5→10 epochs # Focused rare class learning
Joint Phase: 5→8 epochs        # Better integration
```

#### **3. LEARNING RATE SCHEDULE:**
```python
Binary: 0.001                  # Standard for initial learning
Multiclass: 0.0005             # Stable for frozen features
Joint: 0.00005                 # Fine-tuning precision
```

#### **4. DATA AUGMENTATION:**
```python
Rare class threshold: < 100 samples
Augmentation factor: up to 3x
Method: Gaussian noise (1% std)
Target: Classes with < 100 samples
```

#### **5. ADAPTIVE LOSS BALANCING:**
```python
Initial multiclass weight: 0.2
Final multiclass weight: 0.5
Strategy: Gradual increase over training
```

### **📊 EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS:**

#### **Performance Targets:**
- **Multiclass Accuracy**: 32.8% → 55-70%
- **Training Stability**: Better convergence
- **Rare Class Performance**: Significant improvement
- **Overall Robustness**: Enhanced federated learning

#### **Key Improvement Mechanisms:**
1. **More Training Time**: 3x more epochs across all phases
2. **Better Data Balance**: Augmentation for rare classes  
3. **Federated Diversity**: 3 clients vs 2 for better generalization
4. **Progressive Learning**: Adaptive loss weights
5. **Stability**: Lower fine-tuning learning rates

### **🔍 MONITORING METRICS:**

#### **Critical Indicators:**
- Per-class accuracy for attack types 6-9 (rarest)
- Loss convergence stability
- Binary performance maintenance
- Cross-client consistency

#### **Success Criteria:**
- Multiclass accuracy > 60%
- No degradation in binary performance
- Improved rare class recall
- Stable training across all rounds

### **⚡ RUNTIME EXPECTATIONS:**
- **Previous**: ~204 seconds for 2 rounds
- **Enhanced**: ~500-600 seconds for 5 rounds
- **Trade-off**: 3x training time for 2x performance

### **🎯 WHY THIS APPROACH WORKS:**

1. **Class Imbalance**: 412x ratio between most/least common classes
2. **Insufficient Training**: Original 5 epochs insufficient for rare classes
3. **Federated Benefits**: More clients = better generalization
4. **Progressive Learning**: Gradual complexity increase
5. **Data Augmentation**: Synthetic samples for rare classes

---
**Bottom Line**: The 88% improvement (17.4% → 32.8%) in just 2 rounds shows the fixes are working. With 5 rounds, 3 clients, and enhanced training, we should achieve 55-70% multiclass accuracy while maintaining excellent binary performance.
