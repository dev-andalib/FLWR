# Advanced Class Imbalance Solutions for CNN-BiLSTM

## Current Status
- **Multiclass Accuracy Progress**: 8.9% → 42.5% (4.8x improvement!)
- **Critical Issue**: Extreme class imbalance (624x ratio: class 1 has 28,100 vs class 9 has only 45 samples)
- **Current Data Augmentation**: Basic duplication for rare classes (45→90 samples)

## Advanced Solutions to Implement

### 1. Sophisticated Data Augmentation
- **SMOTE-like Interpolation**: Generate synthetic samples between existing rare class samples
- **Gaussian Noise Addition**: Add controlled noise to features for rare classes
- **Feature Mixing**: Combine features from different samples of same rare class
- **Target Multiplier**: Increase rare class samples by 10-20x instead of just 2x

### 2. Advanced Loss Functions
- **Focal Loss**: Focus learning on hard-to-classify examples (rare classes)
- **Class-Balanced Loss**: CB_loss = (1-β)/(1-β^n) * CE_loss where β=0.9999
- **Label Smoothing**: Prevent overconfident predictions on majority classes

### 3. Ensemble Methods
- **Separate Rare Class Models**: Train dedicated models for classes 6-9
- **Cascade Classification**: First classify into groups (frequent vs rare), then fine-classify

### 4. Advanced Sampling Strategies
- **Progressive Sampling**: Gradually increase rare class representation across epochs
- **Hard Example Mining**: Focus on misclassified rare class examples

## Implementation Priority
1. **Immediate**: Enhanced data augmentation (SMOTE-like + noise)
2. **Next**: Focal Loss implementation
3. **Advanced**: Separate rare class specialist models

## Expected Impact
- Target: 55-70% multiclass accuracy (vs current 42.5%)
- Better rare class recall (currently very poor for classes 7-9)
